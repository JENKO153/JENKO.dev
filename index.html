          <h4>Coffee-Fueled Debugging & Scene Fixes</h4>
          <time>June 29, 2025</time>
          <p>Started the day early — like, 6am early — with a strong brew in hand (three coffees before lunch, not even ashamed). I kicked things off by fixing up the computer login screen on the starting level. The original TextEdit boxes felt... clunky. More like a prototype than an actual terminal.</p>
          <p>I swapped them out for LineEdit boxes instead, which gave the whole thing a cleaner, more authentic feel. Then I wired in some basic keyboard input: hitting <strong>TAB</strong> moves the focus from the username field to the password one, and <strong>ENTER</strong> submits the login. Honestly, that little detail made it feel 10x better — like you’re actually logging into something, not just clicking through boxes.</p>
          <p>With that sorted, I jumped into sound design. I added a few basic sound cues to the game — subtle clicks, UI beeps, and ambient touches. Nothing major yet, but even small audio polish gives it that extra "hey, this is a real game" vibe.</p>
          <p>Then came the beast of the day: a door transition bug. Everything looked fine until I changed scenes… and suddenly, the doors in the second level just stopped working. No animation, no logic, nada. I spent a solid 5–6 hours deep-diving into every possible reason — state resets, node parenting, signal breaks, you name it.</p>
          <p>After a mountain of trial and error (and maybe a few curse words), I finally cracked it. Now the doors transition perfectly between levels without breaking. Huge relief — and easily the biggest win of the day.</p>

          <h4>Building the Tutorial System</h4>
          <time>June 28, 2025</time>
          <p>I’ve started programming the tutorial system, and I’m actually really happy with how it’s turning out. Rather than dumping a wall of text at the beginning and hoping the player remembers it all, I’ve gone for a more interactive, gradual approach.</p>
          <p>Once the opening animation finishes, the first prompt appears — just basic movement stuff to get the player warmed up. From there, as the player explores the room, they’ll occasionally enter invisible tutorial trigger zones (Area2Ds). When that happens, their movement freezes and a little prompt fades in explaining the new mechanic.</p>
          <p>After the prompt finishes, movement is re-enabled so the player can immediately try it out. I think this pacing helps a ton — it lets you learn naturally as you go, without sitting through a bunch of text at the start wondering when the actual game kicks in.</p>
          <p>Overall, it feels smoother, more engaging, and way less "hold-your-hand-y" than traditional tutorials. Plus, it sets the tone that this game’s going to teach you on the fly — not lecture you.</p>

          <h4>Crafting the Vibe – Lighting, Shadows & Sound</h4>
          <time>June 27, 2025</time>
          <p>One of the biggest shifts in the game recently has been the atmosphere — I wanted it to feel eerie, haunted, and just tense enough that you’re never fully relaxed. That meant lighting had to do a lot of heavy lifting.</p>
          <p>I started by darkening the whole scene and only selectively lighting key areas — like hallways, doorways, or interactable objects. This gives players that classic "what’s in the shadows?" anxiety. I used soft, low-radius lights and layered shadow effects to keep things murky without being unplayable. It’s meant to feel like your own house but somehow wrong.</p>
          <p>Alongside that, I got to work on some shadowy visuals. I sketched out most of the pixel art myself, aiming for twisted, abstract silhouettes that you wouldn’t want to see move at the end of a corridor. Subtle flickers in the dark, just enough to make your stomach drop.</p>
          <p>Music and sound really glue this all together. I built a looping ambient track that leans into long low notes and reverberating hums, then layered random sound stingers — like distant footsteps, creaking floorboards, or a far-off slam. You never quite know what’s part of the soundtrack and what’s part of the game.</p>
          <p>Every piece here — the light, the shadow, the sound — is meant to crank up the pressure while you're sneaking around. It’s not horror, exactly… but it wants to get under your skin.</p>

          <h4>Developing the Enemy AI Vision System</h4>
          <time>June 27, 2025</time>
            <p>This one was a bit of a grind. Took me a few solid days to nail down, and I probably rewrote the whole thing at least 3 or 4 times before it actually felt right.</p>
            <p>The idea was to give the enemies proper vision cones, so I set up 4 separate sets of RayCasts — one for each direction they might be facing: up, down, left, or right. Each set has 3 rays to form a cone — one straight ahead and two fanned out to the sides.</p>
            <p>Depending on which way the enemy sprite is facing, it activates the matching ray set. When the player walks into the cone, the enemy gets triggered and a big ol' “!” pops up above its head — boom, it’s chase time.</p>
            <p>If you manage to break line of sight, the enemy doesn’t just forget about you. It remembers where it last saw you and heads over there to check things out. While it’s in this “what just happened?” mode, a “?” shows up above its head to show it’s investigating.</p>
            <p>Honestly, it makes stealth feel way more intense. Between all the trial and error and refactoring, I’m really happy with how it turned out. Adds a nice little layer of suspense to sneaking around the house.</p>
