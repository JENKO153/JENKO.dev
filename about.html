          <h3>Hey, I'm Jenko!</h3>
          <p>Hey — I’m Jenko. I’m 25, I live in Melbourne, Australia, and I make games. Most days that means sitting at my desk with way too much coffee, fixing things I broke the night before, and convincing myself that the system I’m working on is definitely going to work this time.
          <p>I’m completely self-taught. No formal training, no shortcuts — just a lot of trial and error, YouTube deep dives, and slowly getting better by actually building things. I started out messing around in Unity, spent a bit of time learning Unreal, and eventually landed in Godot, which is where I feel most at home now. I mostly focus on 2D games and systems-heavy design — the kind of stuff players don’t always notice unless it’s wrong.</p>
          <p>I’m a big believer in foundations. If the core loop isn’t solid, nothing else matters. I’d rather spend extra time getting the underlying systems right than slap features on top of something shaky. A lot of my projects start simple, get messy, get rebuilt, and eventually start feeling like an actual game instead of a collection of experiments.</p>
          <p>Outside of game dev, I’m usually at the gym. Training keeps me sane and gives me something structured to balance out the chaos of development. That mindset carries over into how I work — show up consistently, put the effort in, and let progress stack up over time.</p>
          <p>Coffee is basically a personality trait at this point. I’m not pretending otherwise. Late nights, long debugging sessions, UI redesigns at stupid hours — none of it happens without caffeine. Being in Melbourne definitely doesn’t help that habit.</p>
          <p>This site is where I dump progress, ideas, and dev logs as I build things. It’s not a highlight reel — it’s the process. The good stuff, the broken stuff, and everything in between.</p>
          <p>If you’re into game dev, systems design, or just watching someone slowly figure things out, you’re in the right place.</p>

            <h4>The Journey</h4>
            <p>Started my game dev adventure 3-4 years ago with Unity, explored the power of Unreal Engine for 6 months, then discovered Godot — and never looked back. Now I'm crafting 2D experiences that blend atmospheric storytelling with engaging mechanics.</p>

            <h4>The Balance</h4>
            <p>I juggle a full-time job that takes me away for extended periods, but every spare moment becomes an opportunity to code, design, and create. Game development isn't just a hobby — it's my passion project that keeps me grounded (pun intended).</p>

            <h4>The Tech Stack</h4>
            <p>Currently loving Godot for its flexibility and open-source nature. Experienced with GDScript, pixel art creation, and implementing complex game systems. Always learning, always building, always pushing pixels around until they feel just right.</p>

          <p>When I'm not debugging door transitions at 2 AM or perfecting enemy AI vision cones, you'll find me exploring Melbourne's coffee scene (essential fuel for late-night dev sessions) or planning my next game mechanic.</p>
